# iPALM-GLMF

##  How to use: 
The starting point for running iPALM-DLMF is:  

start.m  
&emsp;&emsp; Run the start.m  and you'll get a final ranking of microbe-disease association predictions.  

positiontooverallaucfold.m  
&emsp;&emsp; This is for plotting the AUC curve for the 5-fold cross-validation.  

positiontooverallauc1.m  
&emsp;&emsp; This is for plotting the AUC curve for the global LOOCV cross-validation.
